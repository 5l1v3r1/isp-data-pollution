# Bandwidth-Limited ISP Data Pollution

Re: [Senate Puts ISP Profits Over Your Privacy](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/senate-puts-isp-profits-over-your-privacy)
 
I pay my ISP a lot for data usage every month. I typically don't use all the bandwidth that I pay for.
If my ISP is going to sell private browsing habits, then I'm going to pollute browsing with noise
and use all the bandwidth that I pay for. This method accomplishes this.

If everyone uses all the data they've paid for to pollute their browsing history, then perhaps ISPs will
reconsider the business model of selling customer's private browsing history.

Alternatively, use a VPN that you believe will protect your privacy.
